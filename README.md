# Spellchecker
Spellchecker built with a trie prefix tree 


The spellchecker program adds every word in the english dictionary into a trie data structure. 

The user is then able to input a word. 
- If it is a valid english word, it will print valid. 
- If it is not a valid english word, it will print all possible words that start with the given prefix. 

Note: The dictionary used is quite extensive, so the spellchecker is very lenient when it comes to checking if a word is valid and it will also show many many suggestions for an invalid word.
